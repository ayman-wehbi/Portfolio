                    <h4>Fact #1</h4>
                    <p>Born in Beirut, Lebanon, I migrated to the US at the age of ten.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <h4>Fact #3</h4>
                    <p>Between ages 11-14, I totaled roughly 480,000 views across two tech-based YouTube channels.</p>
                </div>
				<div class="card" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <h4>Fact #5</h4>
                    <p>I lead all four group projects in during my time in college.</p>

				<div class="card" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <h4>Fact #7</h4>
                    <p>In one of the projects, a member decided to not show up to a single meeting or put in any work. We had most meetings on tuesday nights, but they could not show up due to it being thier "Dungeon and Dragons night"</p>

				<div class="card" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <h4>Fact #9</h4>
                    <p>In our algorithms group project, our team of three could not achieve our complete goal for the project, so other two members decided to not show up for the presentation. I ended up presenting on my own of what we achieved practically, and the rest conceptually and theoritacally.</p>

                    <h4>Fact #11</h4>
                    <p>The most fun I ever had was leading those projects. I deemed the work to be succesful.</p>

                    <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
                    <p>At 12 years old, my Galaxy S smartphone stopped receiving software updates due to Samsung’s policy, but being fascinated with tech, I could not believe that this relatively powerful device could not simply run the newer version of Android, and could not afford to upgrade my hardware to do so. So I started looking for answers until I stumbled upon rooting, custom ROMs, and custom kernels. No different than the feeling of a pilot finding treasure, I started tinkering with my device right away, until I got to the latest version of Android at the time, and prolonged my device’s software-update life for an extra two years.

                    <p>This intrigue carried onto today, 12 years later, creating my own software and delivering it to a world where my goal is to help users and make their lives easier. My work on Nico Studios is targeted to help songwriters, and with Polygons to help users create a personal videogame portfolio. I aspire to do nothing but leave an impact on any creations that I work on with others, or invent and engineer myself.

                    <h4>Fact #2</h4>
                    <p>Between ages 15-18, I totaled roughly 50,000 streams on original music that I composed, wrote, produced, and performed.</p>

                    <h4>Fact #4</h4>
                    <p>After succesfully debugging code, I celebrate like soccer players after they score. This is due to the stressful nature of debugging and the sense of achievement afterwards.</p>

                    <h4>Fact #6</h4>

                    <h4>Fact #10</h4>
                    <p>Programming the jumping mechanic for Nico Strife took about five hours alone, after various and numerous attempts to get the perfect height, drop-speed, and momentum response.</p>

                    <h4>Fact #12</h4>
                    <p>I started cooking to fulfill my cravings, and now I look forward to cooking more than eating the food itself.</p>
