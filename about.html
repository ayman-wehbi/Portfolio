                            <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
                            <p>At 12 years old, my Galaxy S smartphone stopped receiving software updates due to Samsung’s policy, but being fascinated with tech, I could not believe that this relatively powerful device could not simply run the newer version of Android. So I started looking for answers until I stumbled upon rooting, custom ROMs, and custom kernels. No different than the feeling of a pilot finding treasure, I started tinkering with my device right away, until I got to the latest version of Android at the time, and prolonged my device’s software-update life for an extra two years.</p>
                            <p>This intrigue carried onto today, creating my own software and delivering it to a world where my goal is to help users and make their lives easier. My work on Nico Studios is targeted to help songwriters, and with Polygons to help users create a personal video game portfolio. I aspire to do nothing but leave an impact on any creations that I work on with others, or invent and engineer myself.</p>
